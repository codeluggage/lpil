  Virtualboardroom&reg; is the board portal of choice for organisations wanting
  to take advantage of mobile technology and access their information in real
  time.
</p>
<p>
  It can be used on any computer or mobile device, including a PC,
  laptop, smartphone, iPad or any other choice of tablet computer. All you need
  is an internet connection to download your documents, and then you can read
  and annotate them offline just like any other PDF. And with
  Virtualboardroom's extra layer of PDF encryption security, your documents
  will be completely safe.
</p>
<p>
  Virtualboardroom is fully compatible with every tablet on the market, leaving
  the choice in your hands.
