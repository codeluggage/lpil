<p>
  Going “paperless” is a high aspiration – one which Virtualboardroom can help
  you achieve. But perhaps moving towards it through a “paper-lite” phase is a
  more realistic target.
</p>
<p>
  Not everyone feels comfortable reading information electronically and some of
  our clients tell us many users still prefer paper, particularly when
  attending the actual board meeting.
</p>
<p>
  That’s why the Boardpack tool in Virtualboardroom generates, and allows you
  to publish, both a print version and an e-version of your documents. This
  lets you reduce paper usage where individual board members elect to view
  electronically while still giving them choice in their preferred viewing
  method.

  You can still improve your “green” credentials while continuing to use paper
  and this link to the Confederation of Paper Industries website provides a lot
  of useful information on the subject:
