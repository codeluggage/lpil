# Record Gleam Stats

A script that when run will query various things and record the results to
google sheets.

The things:
- The current estimated sponsorship monthly income.
- The number of GitHub stars on gleam-lang/gleam.
- The number of Discord members.
- The number of recent and total Hex downloads of the standard library.
- The number of visitors and views on the website in the last 30 days.
- The number of students, submissions, and mentoring discussions on Exercism.

This is run on GitHub actions periodically.
