title: Looking to join a team
description: A little about me and what I'm looking for. :)
---

Hi, I'm Louis. I'm an experienced software engineer, and I'm looking for an
excellent London based team to join on a permanent or contract basis.

I'm a top-notch programmer with a diverse set of technical skills and
experiences; from full stack web development and cloud computing, to graphics
and audio programming, to static analysis, type systems, and compiler
implementation. Whatever your business problem I am confident I would be a
strong addition to your team.

I believe that software is a team sport, so I value team productivity over
individual productivity. As a team member I aim to help everyone in the team
to contribute as effectively as possible. Empathy and communication are as
important as technical ability in a team, and I am always working to improve
both skill sets.

I think it is important for a team to have sufficient breathing room so they
they can dedicate time to learning, and so they can adapt to unexpected
challenges and setbacks. I enjoy mentoring and would love to work on a team
where I can help junior engineers grow and progress!

I would also like to work for a company that is a force for good in the world,
so that I can take extra pride in my work and really invest in the company.

I've 7+ years of professional experience as a software engineer, the details
of which can be seen on [my LinkedIn profile][linkedin], alongside
recommendations from my former colleagues. I'm a generalist and polyglot
developer, though I most frequently work with Elixir, Erlang, Rust, Go,
Haskell, and JavaScript.

Outside of paid work I am an active open source contributor, primarily working
in the Erlang ecosystem. I've spent the last 3 years designing and
implementing the [Gleam programming language][gleam-github], a highly scalable
and strongly typed language for the Erlang virtual machine. As well as a
technical exercise, Gleam is an exercise in communication and leadership; I
have successfully nurtured a small, friendly, and growing community of people
who kindly donate their free time to help build the language and Gleam
ecosystem. I do a bit of [public speaking][gleam-talk] on the subject too.

I'm proud that the Gleam community contains people of different genders and
demographics, and I hope that any company I join would value diversity too.
Having a diverse team with a diverse set of ideas and experiences both
enriches the culture of the company and the product they produce.

If you think that our values align and that I would made a good addition to
your team please do get touch via [email](mailto:louis@lpil.uk) or via direct
message on [twitter][twitter].
