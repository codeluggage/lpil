<p>
  When you first implement Virtualboardroom, one of our team will come into
  your offices to provide on-site training. Virtualboardroom is intuitive and
  simple to navigate, making it easy for even the most technophobic users to
  adapt to. 
</p>
<p>
  We offer 24/7/365 support and simple user guides to make sure you get the
  very best out of working with Virtualboardroom.
</p>
<p>
  Our support team is based in the City of London and speak plain English, so
  they wonâ€™t blind you with &#8216;techie talk&#8217;.  Our team is very well
  regarded and our clients regularly tell us that our support is the best they
  have ever experienced.
