<p>
Our pricing model is totally transparent and competitive.  
</p>
<p>
  It is based on a price ‘per room’ per quarter model, not ‘per user’*. Once we have had a fair value of usage conversation and agree pricing based on your requirements, the quarterly fees will be fully inclusive of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Full training and implementation
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlimited users
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlimited usage
  </li>
  <li>
    Ongoing 24/7  support
  </li>
  <li>
    All future upgrades and enhancements
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  *In our opinion, the price ‘per user’ model for a board portal is
  fundamentally flawed, as the number of users first envisaged invariably grows
  out of control creating unforeseen additional costs.
