      <span class="home__hi">Hi</span>, I'm Louis, a software engineer and
      music fanatic based in London, UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work for an excellent company called
      <a class="no-wrap" href="http://red-badger.com/" target="_blank">
        Red Badger,</a> and I like to spend my time solving problems with
      languages beginning with the letter 'E' (namely Elixir, Erlang, and Elm).
      I've also been known to use Clojure, Ruby and Javascript when other
      letters take my fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dig functional programming, understandable code, and a test driven
      style of development.
