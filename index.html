    <h1>What it is</h1>
    <h4>Virtualboardroom&reg;</h4>
    <p>
      is a board portal which allows you, very securely, to collaborate with
      others in the compilation of the board pack and then to share that and
      other key board information with directors. The directors can view their
      documents in hard copy printed format or in electronic format on any
      device or through our dedicated VBR App for iPad viewing and annotation.
    </p>
    <h4>Boardpack&reg;</h4>
    <p>
      is a tool that sits within the portal which, very quickly, takes  all
      your report files – Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF – and brings them
      together into one consolidated board pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is being used by company secretaries, administrators and boards the
      world over and can be accessed from anywhere at anytime.
