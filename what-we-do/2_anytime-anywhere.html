  With Virtualboardroom you can keep on top of your board responsibilities from
  wherever you are in the world, whenever you need to.

  It gives you the flexibility to work in the way that best suits you, giving
  you access to your information in real time, via whichever device you choose
  can house all your current and archived board documents, allowing you to
  search for exactly what you need at the touch of a button. With synchronised
  calendars and inter-board communication facilities your boardâ€™s corporate
  governance will be transformed.

  It can be used on any computer or mobile device, including a PC, laptop,
  smartphone, iPad or other tablet computer. All you need is an internet
  connection to download your documents, and then you can read and annotate
  them offline just like any other PDF.

  If using an iPad, the Virtualboardroom app provides all the functionality you
  need to work offline, for further information on our app
