<p>
  It is a truth universally acknowledged that board pack compilation is a
  challenge for any company secretary or administrator. But not when using the
  Boardpack&reg; tool in Virtualboardroom, as board packs can be created at a
  click.

  The Boardpack tool can simultaneously publish either a print ready or an
  e-version of the pack, saving a huge amount of time and effort.
  Virtualboardroom's automatic publishing for print features include sequential
  page numbering throughout the pack and tabs for easy navigation; sleek
  formatting for professional looking documents; consolidation into a single
  PDF for quick printing and distribution; and options to slot in those
  inevitable late files at the last minute changes.
