    I'm a big fan of test driven development and fast feedback loops, so when I
    started learning Elixir I found myself missing the automatic test runners
    of Ruby and Javascript. To resolve this I wrote this handy little library
    that builds upon Vladimir Kirillov and Maxim Sokhatsky's fs project. I use
    this project every day, and it's taught me much about OTP, the BEAM's code
    server, and the Elixir compiler.

    I value consistency and readability in a codebase and I have a soft spot
    for static analysis tools, so I thought it would be fun to write a linter
    of my own. Dogma turned out to be a great exercise for learning about
    abstract syntax trees, parsing, and some of Elixir's less obvious features.
    It's also relatively useful too.

    A fun little toy made in an afternoon to introduce a friend to programming.
    It makes simple noises and colours using the Web Audio API. It probably
    wont work on many browsers... oops...
