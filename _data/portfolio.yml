          A ðŸ’–-y looping animation inspired by 90s cartoons. Rendered in the
          browser using the HTML5 canvas API and written in
          [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), a functional language from the ML
          family.

          The canvas rendering makes use of the Elm graphics library
          which is similar to processing, though declaritive and without
          mutable state. The graphics library handles only plotting to the
          canvas so the animation progression and window resizing is
          hand-rolled in Elm's standard program design pattern.
