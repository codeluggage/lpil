          A ðŸ’–-y looping animation inspired by 90s cartoons. Rendered in the
          browser using the HTML5 canvas API and written in
          [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), a functional language from the ML
          family.

          The canvas rendering makes use of the Elm graphics library
          which is similar to processing, though declaritive and without
          mutable state. The graphics library handles only plotting to the
          canvas so the animation progression and window resizing is
          hand-rolled in Elm's standard program design pattern.

          An interactive kaleidescope toy, written with a student to introduce
          the basics of Javascript and creative coding. p5.js, the Processing
          foundation's Javascript based framework, was used for this sketch.

          The number of points is randomised on load, so hit refresh for
          different patterns!

          A mouse-controlled theremin and simple visualisation written in
          ES6 Javascript. The sound is generated using the HTML5 web audio API,
          and the mouse input is built using DOM event listeners.

          A looping moirÃ© pattern animation. The elements of the animation are
          constructed using the DOM API and then animated using CSS transitions
          and CSS animations.

          With this piece I was very pleased with how such a simple effect can
          build to a captivating effect by stacking addition layers.

          Another looping moirÃ© pattern animation, a continuation of _Conversion
          Bars_.

          This piece's party trick is that it includes no Javascript. Building
          of the pattern is done using _defs_, the often neglected macro-like
          system of SVG. As before the animation is written using CSS
          transitions and animations.
