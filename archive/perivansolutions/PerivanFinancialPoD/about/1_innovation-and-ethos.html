<p>
  With the right kit and skill set, anyone can print, but it's not just about
  pressing buttons. What sets us apart is the Perivan innovative approach and
  ethos, by speaking up and challenging the way things are done "normally" and
  by suggesting alternative methods. This can often mean saving money, but more
  importantly doing things faster and more effectively. 
</p>
<p>
  We work closely with our software solutions divisions and have helped
  companies save vast sums of money and reduce their environmental footprint.
  Our innovation has helped them to streamline their traditional communications
  processes, which often leads to the reduction of their overall requirement
  for print.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of this are the launch of the VirtualboardroomÂ® iPad App where
  companies, who choose to do so, can stop printing their board packs and
  conduct meetings electronically. Our consultation with our annual report
  customers on options available to them through E-comms enables them to reduce
  print, paper and postage costs. For further information click here.

    Our innovation and integrity puts us in a unique situation in this
    marketplace, or any other come to that. Encouraging clients to buy less of
    the service we provide is an unusual concept, and we've been so successful
    in doing it we are now welcoming new clients who we can also do less for.
