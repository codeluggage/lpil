<h4>
  The Company
</h4>
<p>
  W.R. Berkley Syndicate Management Limited
</p>
<h4>
  The Sector
</h4>
<p>
  Lloyd’s Insurance
</p>
<h4>
  The Project
</h4>
<p>
  PRA document request
</p>
<h4>
  The Challenge
</h4>
<p>
  Compile 106 separate files totalling 1,417 pages, and print just 2 copies
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Once they had received all the files, the Perivan team compiled them into
    one consolidated PDF with sequential page numbering and index tabs
    throughout. Even though the documents were sent piecemeal and late in the
    day, the Perivan team worked with me, staying into the evening to ensure my
    document was printed, bound and delivered on time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having a direct delivery service to my client only added to a seamless and
    holistic service, one I could not have duplicated in-house without
    considerable time and effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working with Perivan felt like working with an extension of the WRB team
    based on their ‘can do’ attitude and their pro-active nature to ensure
    WRB’s professional brand was maintained in terms of document output and
    deadline delivery.
