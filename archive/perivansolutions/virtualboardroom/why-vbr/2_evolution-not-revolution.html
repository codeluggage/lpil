<h2>
  Doing things your way, at your pace
</h2>
<p>
  Board communications are changing. Our technology will support your board
  whether you want to go 'paperless', 'paper-lite', or just make your document
  production more efficient. 
</p>
<p>
  We see the move to paperless board meetings as an evolution, not a
  revolution: Virtualboardroom allows you to work in a way, and at a pace of
  your choice.  Access is online, but if board members prefer to stick with
  paper documents as a matter of choice, itâ€™s just as easy to print and produce
  hard copies, and with our in-house printing facilities we can even organise
  this for you.
