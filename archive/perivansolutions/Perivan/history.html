<p>
  Perivan was established in 1937 and evolved gradually into a financial
  printer.
</p>
<p>
  For many years it was part of the Williams Lea Group and its roots
  go very deep, with the Chairman Philip Williams being the fourth generation
  of his family to run a City printing company. 
</p>
<p>
  The business was acquired by the present management and staff in 2003, who
  then set about building the companyâ€™s financial strength, broadening its
  offering and improving its services. Today the company is profitable and debt
  free with substantial cash balances.
