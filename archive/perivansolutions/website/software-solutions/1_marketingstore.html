<p>
  MarketingStore gives you control over all your marketing material, ensuring
  your campaigns are integrated and your messages are consistent.
</p>
<p>
  MarketingStore is a web-based portal where you can create, order and
  distribute all of your marketing material, from adverts and event collateral
  to literature, stationery and multi-channel campaigns. Working from a single
  platform, with pre-approved text and artwork templates, will help your team
  create professional, brand consistent and integrated marketing material in
  line with your current objectives.
</p>
<p>
  Your MarketingStore will be completely bespoke to your company, ensuring you
  have what you need when you need it, and user hierarchies can be created to
  control which members of your team have access to each level, and how much
  they can spend.
</p>
<p>
  All collateral can be ordered directly from the portal, and, if needed, we
  can take over from there.
